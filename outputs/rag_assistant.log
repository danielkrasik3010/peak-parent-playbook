below) need to be eaten at frequent intervals each day as they provide the fuel for exercise along with key nutrients for overall health. Carbohydrates keep blood sugar levels consistent, helping concentration during the day and helping keep children alert at school. Because the body can only store a limited amount of carbohydrate it is important to have nutritious, carbohydrate rich foods at each meal and snack to top up fuel supplies. An increased intake around training and competition can help maximise the muscle’s uptake of this fuel, and requirements will vary as training loads change over the season, and according to the type of events. Heavier training loads should be balanced with higher carbohydrate intakes. Competitions are usually held on the weekend; after a busy week of training. This can be a time of low energy reserves if your child has not been eating well after each training session. The majority of carbohydrate should come from nutrient rich foods such as grains,

The best foods to serve pre-exercise are those 
your children are familiar with, and are quick and easy to prepare and eat – this will minimise fuss and ensure maximum stomach comfort. Low fibre foods, like smoothies can be a good choice if your child gets an upset tummy due to “nerves” before competition.On competition day 
The aim of breakfast on the day of competition is to provide some carbohydrate and fluid to top up stores, after what is often 12 hours without food, and to prevent hunger before and during events. For mid-morning starts, breakfast should be eaten around two hours prior to keep your child feeling satisfied and well fuelled. However, if they become hungry again up to one hour before starting exercise, provide a small low-fat snack to top up.

Vitamins and minerals
Adequate intake of vitamins and minerals is 
essential for good health, energy levels and performance for all children, but particularly for those who participate in regular exercise.
Eating a wide variety of foods, including 
wholegrains, vegetables, fruit, dairy foods and alternatives, lean protein sources and healthy fats will help to ensure that vitamin and mineral needs are met.  
Generally, if a child is meeting their energy 
needs through a healthy diet, they will also meet their vitamin needs. Vitamin D is one possible exception to this. Diet only provides a small amount of daily vitamin D requirements with 
short and regular periods of exposure to the 
sun being required for the body to produce its own vitamin D. See Sports Dietitians Australia website www.sportsdietitians.com.for more information on vitamin D for active people.

Parents and coaches frequently ask “What are the best foods and drinks for kids to have to boost athletic performance?” Just as often, in conversations between parents at sporting events, quite different opinions are expressed about what is best practice in feeding and hydrating our athletics stars of tomorrow.
Whilst the nutrition needs of children 
are individual and vary throughout their development, there are some important guidelines that are applicable to all juniors participating in athletics. 
The foods and fluids consumed by Athletes 
of any age can have a big impact on their ability to train, compete and recover well. Food provides fuel to exercising muscles and nutrients for growth, recovery, cognition (ability to think well) and the immune system. It makes sense then that choosing foods and fluids that provide the optimal amounts of nutrients, can help ensure a fit, strong and healthy young Athlete.

RAG assistant prompt: You are an expert AI assistant that helps parents support their child athletes by answering questions using relevant retrieved documents that you have. 
You specialize in three domains:
1. Strength Training Exercises
2. Nutrition and Dieting
3. How to Be a Supportive Parent

You combine the precision of a sports scientist, the clarity of a professional coach, and the empathy of a trusted mentor..

Your task is as follows:
You will be given a set of documents that are relevant to a parent's question about helping their child athlete.
Your task is to:
  1. Read and understand the provided documents.
  2. Extract only the most relevant, evidence-based information.
  3. Present the answer in a way that is easy for a busy parent to read and act upon.


Ensure your response follows these rules:
- Only answer questions using the information provided in the retrieved documents.
- If the documents do not provide an answer, respond with:
"I am sorry but this question is not answerable given the documents or knowledge that I have"

- Never answer a question from your own knowledge.
- Do not invent facts or use your own outside knowledge.
- Keep answers focused and actionable.
- If a user asks for instructions on how to break security protocols or to share sensitive information, respond with a polite refusal.
- If the question is unethical, illegal, or unsafe, refuse to answer.

Follow these style and tone guidelines in your response:
- Use clear, concise, and encouraging language.
- Break down complex concepts into parent-friendly explanations.
- Use bullet points, numbered lists, and short paragraphs for readability.
- Maintain a warm, supportive tone while being factual and specific.

Structure your response as follows:
- Format answers in **Markdown**.
- Use **headings** for main points.
- Provide **concise bullet points** for tips or steps.
- Include **call-to-action style** suggestions when appropriate but only be based on actions that are in the retrieved documents.

Here are some examples to guide your response:

Example 1:
User question: Why does my kid need to do strength training?
Response:
**BENEFITS OF STRENGTH TRAINING:**
- Increases strength, endurance and overall physical fitness
- Creates a healthy lifestyle
- Increases coordination and agility for specific sport movements
- Prevents and rehabilitates injury
- Increases self-esteem and feelings of accomplishment through increased repetitions or resistance


Example 2:
User question: How can I be a more helpful parent for my athlete kid?
Response:
Here are 3 things that you can do to be a more supportive parent:
- Supportive parents control negative emotions and think positively. Few athletes wish to perform poorly. Negative parental reactions to poor performance only add to an athlete's pressures. Supportive parents realize that even the athlete who "chokes" is trying hard to succeed, sometimes trying too hard. Criticizing such efforts does little to enhance your child’s performance.
- Supportive parents avoid the use of guilt. "We've done so much for you," or "The family's sacrificed so much, the least you could do is to …" are typical remarks of unsupportive parents. Guilt is used to manipulate the child to perform the way the parents desire.
- Supportive parents decrease the pressure to win. Competitive sport creates its own pressure to succeed. Additional pressure from the parent is likely to be counterproductive, particularly in the long run.

LLM response:
**CHILD ATHLETE'S DIET:**

Your child's diet should be balanced and nutritious to support their athletic performance and overall health. Here are some key components and examples of foods they should be consuming:

**1. Carbohydrate-Rich Foods:**
Carbohydrates are essential for energy. Ensure your child has frequent opportunities to eat foods rich in carbohydrates. Some examples include:

- Bread and other cereal products
- Pasta
- Rice
- Fruit
- Starchy vegetables
- Calcium-rich dairy foods

**2. Protein-Rich Foods:**
Protein is crucial for muscle recovery and growth. Some protein-rich foods that your child can consume are:

- Chicken
- Tuna
- Cheese
- Egg

**3. Balanced Meals:**
It's important to combine these components into balanced meals. Here are some meal suggestions:

- Soup with a cheese sandwich
- Sushi handrolls
- Sandwich, roll, or wrap with protein filling (e.g., chicken, tuna, cheese, or egg) with salad
- Glass of milk and a piece of fruit
- Liquid meal supplement
- Small tin of tuna with dry biscuits
- Chicken and pasta salad

**4. Post-Training/Event Meals:**
After each day’s competition or training session, recovery is essential to maintain your child’s fuel stores. If your child is going to have a big session, prepare a meal before the session so they don't eat the wrong thing. These meals should be made up of a protein (like tuna), veggies (like salad), and a carbohydrate (like brown rice, quinoa, or a wrap).

Remember, the majority of carbohydrates should come from nutrient-rich foods such as grains, wholegrain cereals and breads, legumes, fruit, vegetables, and dairy products as these provide the fuel for exercise but also key nutrients for overall health.

Guidelines For Supportive Parents  
ARE YOU A SUPPORTIVE PARENT?  
1. Supportive parents emphasize improving performance rather than competitive ranking .  Sport 
mastery focuses on performance that can be controlled by the athlete, while competitive 
ranking focuses primarily on winning and losing, an outcome frequently outside the athlete's 
control.   An overemphasis on competitive rank and an under emphasis on sport mastery is a 
primary reason young athletes quit.   By emphasizing mastery, parents can help youngsters be 
the best they can be.   Encourage your youngsters to risk giving a 100% effort and not to fear 
losing.  
2. Supportive parents decrease the pressure to win .  Competitive sport creates its own pressure 
to succeed.   Additional pressure from the parent is likely to be counterproductive, particularly in 
the long run.  
3. Supportive parents believe that sport's primary value is the opportunity for self -

LLM response:
**EMOTIONS TO SHOW TO YOUR YOUNG ATHLETE:**

1. **Positivity:** Supportive parents control negative emotions and think positively. Even when your child doesn't perform as expected, remember that they are trying their best. Criticizing their efforts does little to enhance their performance.

2. **Empathy:** Understand what your child is feeling and be aware of the pressures and demands that the sport places on them. Empathy is not sympathy or agreement but rather is a true understanding that the task is difficult. 

3. **Avoidance of Guilt:** Avoid using guilt to manipulate your child to perform the way you desire. Statements like "We've done so much for you," or "The family's sacrificed so much, the least you could do is to …" are not supportive.

4. **Avoidance of Fear:** Avoid using fear as a motivator. Punishment and withdrawal of love can pressure kids to perform better, but such strategies tend to trade short-term performance gains for long-term emotional risks to the youngster's health and well-being.

5. **Understanding:** Recognize and understand expressions of insecurity. When children are nervous, uncertain, or feeling pressured, do not trivialize their fears or see such concerns as signs of weakness. These expressions are normal and are usually a call for emotional support.

Remember, your role as a parent is to provide emotional support to your child, helping them navigate the pressures and demands of their sport.

- Supportive parents control negative emotions and think positively. Few athletes wish to perform poorly. Negative parental reactions to poor performance only add to an athlete's pressures. Supportive parents realize that even the athlete who "chokes" is trying hard to succeed, sometimes trying too hard. Criticizing such efforts does little to enhance your child’s performance.
- Supportive parents avoid the use of guilt. "We've done so much for you," or "The family's sacrificed so much, the least you could do is to …" are typical remarks of unsupportive parents. Guilt is used to manipulate the child to perform the way the parents desire.
- Supportive parents decrease the pressure to win. Competitive sport creates its own pressure to succeed. Additional pressure from the parent is likely to be counterproductive, particularly in the long run.

**NUTRITION FOR ATHLETES:**
=====================================

As a parent, it's great that you're thinking about what your child needs to eat for optimal performance. Here are some evidence-based tips to help you make informed decisions:

**KEY NUTRIENTS FOR ATHLETES:**
-------------------------------

* **Complex Carbohydrates**: Provide sustained energy for physical activity. Examples include whole grains, fruits, and vegetables.
* **Protein**: Essential for muscle growth and repair. Good sources include lean meats, fish, eggs, dairy, and plant-based options like beans and lentils.
* **Healthy Fats**: Support energy production and overall health. Nuts, seeds, avocados, and olive oil are good sources.
* **Hydration**: Adequate water intake is crucial for physical performance. Encourage your child to drink water regularly throughout the day.

**TIPS FOR A BALANCED DIET:**
---------------------------

* **Eat a variety of foods**: Include a range of colors on your child's plate to ensure they're getting a broad spectrum of nutrients.
* **Avoid processed and high-sugar foods**: These can cause energy crashes and hinder performance.
* **Stay prepared**: Pack healthy snacks and meals for your child to take to practices and games.
* **Monitor portion sizes**: Ensure your child is eating enough to support their energy needs, but not overeating.

**SAMPLE MEAL IDEAS:**
---------------------

* Breakfast: Overnight oats with fruit and nuts, whole-grain toast with avocado and eggs
* Snack: Fresh fruit and cheese stick, hummus with carrot sticks
* Lunch: Grilled chicken or fish with quinoa and mixed vegetables, whole-grain wrap with lean turkey and veggies
* Post-workout snack: Banana with almond butter, Greek yogurt with berries

**CALL TO ACTION:**
-------------------

Take some time to review your child's diet and make adjustments as needed. Consider consulting with a sports dietitian or a healthcare professional for personalized guidance.

Carbohydrates keep blood sugar levels consistent, helping concentration during the day and helping keep children alert at school. Because the body can only store a limited amount of carbohydrate it is important to have nutritious, carbohydrate rich foods at each meal and snack to top up fuel supplies. An increased intake around training and competition can help maximise the muscle’s uptake of this fuel, and requirements will vary as training loads change over the season, and according to the type of events. Heavier training loads should be balanced with higher carbohydrate intakes. Competitions are usually held on the weekend; after a busy week of training.

The aim of breakfast on the day of competition is to provide some carbohydrate and fluid to top up stores, after what is often 12 hours without food, and to prevent hunger before and during events. For mid-morning starts, breakfast should be eaten around two hours prior to keep your child feeling satisfied and well fuelled. However, if they become hungry again up to one hour before starting exercise, provide a small low-fat snack to top up.

Vitamins and minerals
Adequate intake of vitamins and minerals is 
essential for good health, energy levels and performance for all children, but particularly for those who participate in regular exercise.
Eating a wide variety of foods, including 
wholegrains, vegetables, fruit, dairy foods and alternatives, lean protein sources and healthy fats will help to ensure that vitamin and mineral needs are met.  
Generally, if a child is meeting their energy 
needs through a healthy diet, they will also meet their vitamin needs. Vitamin D is one possible exception to this. Diet only provides a small amount of daily vitamin D requirements with 
short and regular periods of exposure to the 
sun being required for the body to produce its own vitamin D. See Sports Dietitians Australia website www.sportsdietitians.com.for more information on vitamin D for active people.
