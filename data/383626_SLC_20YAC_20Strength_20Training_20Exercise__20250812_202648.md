STRENGTH TRAINING EXERCISE PROGRAM
Strength training can help young athletes increase strength 
and overall health when performed in a safe, supervised 
environment. By focusing more on proper technique and less on 
the amount of resistance, the benefits of youth strength training 
far outweigh the risks. 
Before beginning any strength training program, consult your 
primary care provider if you have any questions about whether 
your child should participate. It’s also important to follow 
the guidelines of a well-designed program and have adult 
supervision. Most injuries that occur during strength training are 
due to improper technique, misuse of equipment and/or lifting 
inappropriate amounts of weight. 
RULES OF STRENGTH TRAINING:
• Always have adult supervision
• Always have a person spotting when using weights  
and resistance
• Use equipment properly
• No horseplay
• Always put equipment away after useKEYS TO A SUCCESSFUL STRENGTH TRAINING PROGRAM: 
• Warm-up before and cool-down after each workout 
• Focus on proper technique and form (see exercise 
descriptions and pictures)
• Strength training sessions should be done 2-3 times  
per week (non-consecutively)
 –Strength training sessions should last at least  
20-30 minutes 
 –Each session should include 6-8 exercises with  
2-3 exercises per muscle group
 –Start with 1-2 sets of 10-15 repetitions (reps),  
moving up to 2-3 sets
 –Single ‘maximum’ repetitions should be avoided until  
a young athlete has finished puberty
• Start each session with more complex exercises, then 
progress to more isolated exercises
 –Complex exercises: These exercises usually work 
major muscle groups and/or multiple muscle groups 
throughout the exercise.
 –Isolated exercises: These exercises usually work one 
muscle or minor muscle groups.
• Increase weight, sets and/or reps slowly 
 –Increase weight by 5-10% when the athlete can do  
15 reps without muscle failure.
 –Be patient. Expect to see results after 8-12 weeks  
of strength training.
 –Be consistent. Strength decreases 3% each week, 
with gains completely lost 8 weeks after discontinuing 
strength training.
• Allow muscles to recover by having at least one  
rest or cross training day in between each strength 
training session.
BENEFITS OF STRENGTH TRAINING: 
• Increases strength, endurance and overall  
physical fitness
• Creates a healthy lifestyle
• Increases coordination and agility for specific  
sport movements
• Prevents and rehabilitates injury
• Increases self-esteem and feelings of accomplishment 
through increased repetitions or resistance
