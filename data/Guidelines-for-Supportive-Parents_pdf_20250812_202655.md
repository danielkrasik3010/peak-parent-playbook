Guidelines For Supportive Parents  
ARE YOU A SUPPORTIVE PARENT?  
1. Supportive parents emphasize improving performance rather than competitive ranking .  Sport 
mastery focuses on performance that can be controlled by the athlete, while competitive 
ranking focuses primarily on winning and losing, an outcome frequently outside the athlete's 
control.   An overemphasis on competitive rank and an under emphasis on sport mastery is a 
primary reason young athletes quit.   By emphasizing mastery, parents can help youngsters be 
the best they can be.   Encourage your youngsters to risk giving a 100% effort and not to fear 
losing.  
2. Supportive parents decrease the pressure to win .  Competitive sport creates its own pressure 
to succeed.   Additional pressure from the parent is likely to be counterproductive, particularly in 
the long run.  
3. Supportive parents believe that sport's primary value is the opportunity for self -
development.   The probability of achieving lasting fame and glory via sport is extremely 
low.   Sport's  value is the opportunity it gives participants for self -development.   Many 
outstanding athletes never achieve professional status, but their sports experiences allow them 
to develop lifelong values and self -respect.  
4. Supportive parents understand the risks .  Competition places the athlete on center 
stage.   Anytime you attempt to succeed publicly where others can judge you, you risk failing.   In 
the long run, competing is a willingness to chance failure.   Striving to win and giving your best 
are what athleti cs are all about.  
5. Supportive parents communicate their true concerns directly with the coach.   A positive 
working relationship is based upon clearly communicated, mutual goals among parents, 
coaches, and athletes.   While parents cannot control the behavior  of a coach, you can and 
should communicate with the coach on a regular basis about your concern for your child’s 
overall development.  
6. Supportive parents understand and respect the differences between parental roles and 
coaching roles.   Both parents and co aches need to understand their different roles in supporting 
the young athlete.  While parents are ultimately responsible for their child's development, once 
they have selected a coach, they must leave the coaching to the coach.   Even though supportive 
parents can and should play sports with their child, you should avoid coaching "over the 
shoulder" of the coach and/or publicly questioning coaching decisions.  
7. Supportive parents control negative emotions and think positively .  Few athletes wish to 
perform po orly.   Negative parental reactions to poor performance only add to an athlete's 
pressures.   Supportive parents realize that even the athlete who "chokes" is trying hard to 
succeed, sometimes trying too hard.  Criticizing such efforts does little to enhance  your child’s 
performance.  
8. Supportive parents avoid the use of fear .  Punishment and withdrawal of love can pressure kids 
to perform better.   Unfortunately, such strategies tend to trade short -term performance gains

for long -term emotional risks to the you ngster's health and well -being.   Supportive parents 
recognize that a love for sport is rarely fostered by fear of the consequences of failure.  
9. Supportive parents avoid criticizing.   Nagging parents often confuse support with constantly 
reminding the childr en that they need to practice more, condition more, concentrate more, 
etc.  Overly involved parents frequently lose their objectivity.   They are unable to provide the 
critical emotional support children often need before, during and after highly competitiv e 
contests.  
10. Supportive parents recognize and understand expressions of insecurity.  Youngsters who 
express high anxiety, more often than not, have parents who are insensitive to their 
symptoms.   When children are nervous, uncertain, or feeling pressured, in sensitive parents may 
trivialize the child's fears or see such concerns as signs of weakness.   Realize that such 
expressions are normal and are usually a call for emotional support.  
11. Supportive parents avoid the use of guilt.  "We've done so much for you," o r "The family's 
sacrificed so much, the least you could do is to …" are typical remarks of unsupportive 
parents.   Guilt is used to manipulate the child to perform the way the parents desire.  
12. Supportive parents show empathy for the young athlete.   Empathy i s an understanding of what 
the child is feeling and an awareness of the pressures and demands that the sport places on the 
athlete.   Empathy is not sympathy or agreement but rather is a true understanding that the task 
is difficult.   A sympathetic response  to an expression of doubt by the athlete might be "Perhaps 
you're right.   It might be too difficult.   Maybe you shouldn't compete today."   Empathy on the 
other hand might be expressed by a supportive parent as "Yes, it will probably be a tough match 
today .  That’s exciting!   C'mon, let me help you get ready."
