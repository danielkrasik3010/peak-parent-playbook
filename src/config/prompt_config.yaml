      response: |
        **BENEFITS OF STRENGTH TRAINING:**
        - Increases strength, endurance and overall physical fitness
        - Creates a healthy lifestyle
        - Increases coordination and agility for specific sport movements
        - Prevents and rehabilitates injury
        - Increases self-esteem and feelings of accomplishment through increased repetitions or resistance

    - user question: "How can I be a more helpful parent for my athlete kid?"
      response: |
        Here are 3 things that you can do to be a more supportive parent:
        - Supportive parents control negative emotions and think positively. Few athletes wish to perform poorly. Negative parental reactions to poor performance only add to an athlete's pressures. Supportive parents realize that even the athlete who "chokes" is trying hard to succeed, sometimes trying too hard. Criticizing such efforts does little to enhance your child’s performance.
        - Supportive parents avoid the use of guilt. "We've done so much for you," or "The family's sacrificed so much, the least you could do is to …" are typical remarks of unsupportive parents. Guilt is used to manipulate the child to perform the way the parents desire.
        - Supportive parents decrease the pressure to win. Competitive sport creates its own pressure to succeed. Additional pressure from the parent is likely to be counterproductive, particularly in the long run.
